<p>Shaping is performed in a machine tool called shaper whereas the machine tool for planning is called a planer. In a planar machine, the tool is stationary and work piece travels back and forth under the tool. The planer machine is also a reciprocating type of machine tool like a shaper. The size of the shaper is specified by the maximum length of stroke or cut it makes.</p>
<h3 id="the-maximum-stroke-length-of-the-shaper-is-900-mm">The maximum stroke length of the shaper is 900 mm.</h3><p>It is similar to the shaper machine but in case of size, the planer machine is larger. It is capable of a machining heavy workpiece, which cannot be fit on a. In the shaper machine, cutting tool moves while in that of the metalworking planer workpiece moves. Planer planing can be used to produce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces that are too large to be accommodated on shapers. Tools are smaller in size. A shaping machine is a reciprocating type of machine tool.</p>
