<p>When unusually many children come visiting and tease the dog it may respond by hiding in the closet under furniture and in other suitable places that are devoid of light for as long as the children are around. Praising your dog when they are nervous only encourages nervous behaviors. Your dog will sit upright in your chair and stare at you as you try to get him off your seat. LOL Seriously your scent is all over. My Dog Luna Loves To Lay Under My Chair While I Game Yes Im Careful Not To Move While Shes Underneath Http Ift Tt 2gtjyv0 Dogs I Like Dogs Pets.</p>

<p>First do not pet or encourage your dog when they go between your legs. LOL Seriously your scent is all over. The reason why it does it could be that it feels safer there. He is aware that you are secure enough to go there to rest and feel like a valuable family.
