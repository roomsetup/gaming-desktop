<p>When you go into the room sit still and talk gently to the cat but do not force yourself on the pet allow the cat to come and investigate you so there are no feelings of being threatened. Ideally both rooms should be out of the way so your cat can be left undisturbed for as much of the move as possible. On average a new cat may stay in the Bonding Room for 2 - 7 days but generally the cat will let you know when he is ready for the next step. At times there is is no time at all in a manner to say how long. Indeed when you introduce a new cat to existing cats in a household it is advised that you keep the cat in a room for several days to allow a gentle introduction.</p>

I totally believe that how long it takes a cat to settle into depends on each individual cat its personality and its circumstances. It also depends on how long the cat is kept in a single room. It is also easier for toilet training and cleaning. 10 Ways To Keep Your House Clean For Cat Owners By Cat Owners Clean House Cat Owners Cats.</p>

<p>When you go into the room sit still and talk gently to the cat but do not force yourself on the pet allow the cat to come and investigate you so there are no feelings of being threatened. But this is a guide because each kitten responds differently. Let him come out of his own accord and keep the door open so he can dash back to his refuge. At the same time decide on a room in the new home where you can put your cat when you get there. Dog Proof Cat Feeding Station Supercoolpets Com Cat Feeding Station Cat Feeding Cat Food Station.</p>

<p>Personally with a kitten of 6 months I would be keeping the doors shut to rooms you dont want her to have access to at the momentrather than her shut in one roomJudge how much freedom she should have on how she copes with a couple of rooms to explore while you are aroundgradually allowing her in to all the rooms that you want her to have access toAs long as. For at least seven days keep the new cat in a separate room with food drink comfy bedding litter box es and everything else he needs to be happy and healthy. I would say it depends on the cat - go with your gut instincts. Cats like whats in a room not necessarily the size of a room.
