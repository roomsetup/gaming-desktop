Although your country’s climate or ambient room temperature plays a major factor in this, a minimum of three fans is recommended. In that case, you might benefit from a third small intake fan to keep the system balanced. Standard sizes range from 80mm to 250mm, and you’ll generally need larger fans for larger pc cases, since they’ll need to move more air. Larger fans are better in terms of noise as they don’t need to spin as fast for reasonable airflow, reducing noise especially at idle. More fans can be louder under light load.</p>
