<p>You can adjust wheelchair height according to your needs and requirements which is why this is the best wheelchair for big and tall. If the footrest length is too short the knees are elevated off the wheelchair seat and more of the users weight is transferred back onto the buttocks. Please be careful when preforming adjustments to the Orion II wheelchair and reference the Seat to Floor Height Guide in the Order form and in the Parts Book to ensure the chair functions safely. Im always open to suggestions on how this site can be improved or requests for information that I havent covered.
