<p>If your chair doesnt have adequate spine support this will lead to poor posture which stresses the soft tissues and joints in the spine leading to pain. Some of the most common causes of lower back pain are a lack of lumbar support from a chair thats too soft or one that doesnt encourage good posture a muscular imbalance in which your pectoral muscles chest are stronger than your back muscles common in men who like to work out their beach muscles more than their back or habit.
