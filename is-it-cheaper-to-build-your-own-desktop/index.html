However, you forfeit the time and less risk of damaging the pc components if you decide to build a pc from scratch rather than buy a prebuilt version. For that range (brought to you by uk boutique builder, fierce pc) the cheapest model comes in at around £560 (roughly $775), and the most expensive at.
