<h3 id="consider-a-compact-keyboard-so-that-the-mouse-is-a-comfortable-reach-for-the-arm">Consider a compact keyboard so that the mouse is a comfortable reach for the arm.</h3><p>People who are particularly short or tall may prefer an adjustable desk that they can customize for their use. Once you have found the proper height for your screen, relax your arms next to your side. The best size for people with short height of 5 to 5.5 feet is a size office chair, the b size office chair is good for people with height 5.6 to 6 feet and for people with height 6 feet above is c size office chair. For someone at 6 feet tall, the perfect height for a standing desk will be around 109cm, though there will be some variation as everyone’s body proportions are different.
