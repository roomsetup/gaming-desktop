<p>I have series x hdmi to denon amp. Xbox series x loud disc drive sound issue. What i would like to do is maybe add an inline micro usb to micro usb with power button. If this can be resolved it would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

If this can be resolved it would be greatly appreciated!! Unfortunately, there is no way to stop the ir from powering on devices within its range, however, there is a way to prevent all consoles that are not your primary consoles from powering on or off your additional equipment like your tv or your sound systems. I do get some audio sync issues with the cx but that is normally from the internal apps, firestick and series x have all been fine so far. The mix amp does not have a power button. Sound issues may develop due to temporary software glitches.</p>
