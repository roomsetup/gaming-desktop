<p><strong>How To Keep Pet Hair Off Furniture</strong>, The only way to ensure pet hair is not on your bed or in certain areas is to keep your pet out of these rooms. If I dont have time to do a thorough vacuuming or Ive got a chair that is particularly covered in hair running a slightly damp paper towel over the area works well too. Give your pet a quick brushing every day or at least a few times a week to remove dead hair before it falls off do this outside or in the garage if you can. Dogs with long hair may require grooming more frequently.</p>
