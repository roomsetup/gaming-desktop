Nvidia geforce rtx 30 series or any of its equivalent brands, such as those from amd, should be more than enough.</p>

From all of my “experience” in gaming (which is actually not that much) the best possible “gaming” pc you can get is one that you can afford and one that you can genuinely enjoy. For most games, 8gb of onboard memory is the benchmark. In my experience gamin pc’s that are hot and loud and very large are not very enjoyable. Gaming pcs are versatile pieces of technology. The acer predator triton 300 se is a good option for both work and play.</p>
