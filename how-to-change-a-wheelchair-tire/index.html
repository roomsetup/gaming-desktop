<p>In my experience bike shops have better prices and variety than wheelchair specific stores a basic MTB tire can run you anywhere from 20-40 and up per tire. Knobby tires are readily available for standard-size wheelchair wheels of 24 25 and 26 inches. Generally you need to replace the wheels with the same type and size. The diameter of most solid wheelchair tires is typically 2 3 smaller than the wheel youll be putting them on.
