<p>Our top pick for the best gaming chair right now is the Secretlab Titan from 399. What I personally use is an IKEA Markus which IMO is pretty much the best chair you can get for 200 brand new. But if you dont have an IKEA nearby it may be hard to get your hands on one. Browse Our Latest Gaming Gear at Argos and Get Gaming Ready.

<p>The Deerhunter Gaming Chair is our top Reddit-recommended choice if your gaming space isnt air conditioned. The Icon is the brands most popular chair and is generally considered a bit more comfortable than the Epic and Hero models. When I bought my chair I just went to Staples and sat on each chair until I found one I like. They are typically better for posture and they are much cheaper than the ones that are marketed for gamers.

<p>Noblechairs is a well respected brand in the gaming industry. They generally have better ergonomics than equivalently-priced gaming chairs. The Icon is the brands most popular chair and is generally considered a bit more comfortable than the Epic and Hero models. Under those circumstances a leather seat can quickly get sweaty which means you end up with a condition the kids call stank booty or swamp ass.
